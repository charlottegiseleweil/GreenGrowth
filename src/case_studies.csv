Eligible farmers who choose to enroll in CRP are compensated.",
6,Public Payments - Government Payments,6.2,United States,New York City’s Water Supply,"New York City’s water system provides 4.5 million cubic meters of water per day to over 9 million people in and around the city. All of the water comes from surface sources: three watersheds located 80-200 km outside the city – the Croton, Catskill and Delaware watersheds. New York City initially provided USD 350 million in funding in 1997 for a variety of activities aimed at maintaining water quality of the upstream watersheds. To date, the city has spent approximately USD 1.5 billion in total.",
6,Public Payments - Government Payments,6.3,South Africa,Working for Water in South Africa,"Water scarcity is a major challenge for the country of South Africa. Invasive alien plants in South Africa, including trees such as pines, eucalyptus and wattles, as well as riparian woody species, use more water than the native vegetation they replace. Compensation is provided to the people who clear the plants.",
7,Regulatory-Driven Mitigation,7.1,United States,"Green Infrastructure Investment for Stormwater Management in Washington, DC","In the absence of stormwater management infrastructure (either nature-based “green” infrastructure or engineered “grey” infrastructure), stormwater that lands on roofs and paved surfaces picks up sediment, oil and other pollutants and washes them into sewers, which then flow to DC’s three rivers (the Potomac, Anacostia and Rock Creek) and into the Chesapeake Bay. When high volumes of water end up in streams after storms, this erodes stream channels, and the sediment is carried downstream, degrading aquatic habitat. Under DC’s stormwater regulations, regulated development projects are required to retain a certain amount of stormwater (Stormwater Retention Volume or SWRv). ",
7,Regulatory-Driven Mitigation,7.2,United States,Wetlands Mitigation Banking in the United States,"More than 50% of the wetlands in the continental United States have been drained, filled and converted to development, agriculture and other uses that were traditionally considered more economically productive. In the 200 years between 1780 and 1980, wetlands were lost at an average rate of 25 hectares per hour, and the state of California lost more than 90% of its wetlands. Mitigation banks restore, create or enhance wetland habitat and functions.",
7,Regulatory-Driven Mitigation,7.3,United States,Conservation Banking in California,"Inspired by the wetlands mitigation banking associated with the federal Clean Water Act in the United States (Case 2 in this chapter), the state of California created its own conservation banking program for threatened and endangered species and habitats.",
7,Regulatory-Driven Mitigation,7.4,United States,Carbon Markets in California,"As defined under AB-32’s Forest Offsets program, the ecosystem service suppliers are parties that choose to undertake emission reduction projects and sell the credits they generate to companies regulated under AB-32. Close to 800,000 hectares within 59 forest management projects across the continental United States have been approved to sell offset credits under California cap-and-trade market for greenhouse gas emissions.",
8,Voluntary Conservation,8.1,Brazil,ARPA (Amazon Region Protected Areas Program) with the Transition Fund,"The Brazilian Amazon, which includes around 60% of the total Amazon forest, has lost nearly 20% of its forest cover since 1970, a result of logging, agricultural expansion and other development. This amounts to a loss of over 750,000 km2. ARPA donors created a Transition Fund, a long-term sinking fund, designed to cover recurrent costs of ARPA for 25 years. The fund has a target of USD 215 million, with nearly USD 211 million committed as of May 2016.",
8,Voluntary Conservation,8.2,United States,Land Trusts and Conservation Easements in the United States,"Over 70% of land in the United States is privately owned, nearly 10 times the amount of land in IUCN-categorized protected areas (within the 48 contiguous states). Land trusts are private, non-profit organizations that acquire and steward land for conservation. When a private land owner wants to place a conservation easement on their land, they enter into an agreement with a land trust.",

The region contains 20% of the country’s agricultural land area and produces one-third of its food supply, including nearly AUS$7 billion in irrigated produce. The Murray-Darling Basin Water Fund buys water rights and each year leases between 60-90% of its water to farmers for agricultural purposes. Profits from leasing water rights go back to fund investors. The Fund donates the remaining 10-40% of its water holdings to wetland restoration.",

13,Costa Rica,13,Costa Rica,MAINSTREAMING VALUES OF NATURAL CAPITAL INTO POLICY AND FINANCE: THE CASE OF COSTA RICA,"Costa Rica is unique in several ways. A key factor is the country’s geographic location as narrow land bridge between the great landmasses of North and South America. Its rugged topography includes mountains that rise up to 3800 meters above sea level, and its land bears two different seasonal regimes that contribute to its extremely varied habitats. Costa Rica’s biological diversity is outstanding in the Americas as well as in the tropical world as a whole. With a land area of only 51,000 square kilometers, it contains nearly 5% of all plant and animal species known to exist on the planet. In addition to this rich biodiversity, the country’s long-standing efforts in conservation are well known. They include a system of national parks and protected areas, many of which are World Heritage Sites.",
14,US Coastal Resilience and Climate Adaptation,14.1,United States,Ecosystem Restoration in the US Gulf Coast,"The Gulf Coast ecosystem is vital to the people, environment and economy of the United States, providing abundant seafood, valuable energy resources, diverse recreational activities, and a rich cultural heritage. The total funding for ecosystem and economic restoration in the Gulf Coast from the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill amounts to more than US$20 billion, with the major funding streams being ~US$5.5 billion from Civil Penalties under the Clean Water Act to be dispersed according to the RESTORE Act, just over US$2.5 billion to be administered by NFWF, and no more than $8.8 billion from NRDA.",
14,US Coastal Resilience and Climate Adaptation,14.2,United States,Post-disaster investments for coastal resilience along the eastern US,"Hurricane Sandy was one of the deadliest and most costly hurricanes in United States history. When it hit the eastern seaboard as a Category 2 hurricane, it became the largest Atlantic hurricane on record. At least 223 people were killed, including 160 in the US alone, and damages amounted to more than $75 billion. A total of 24 states were affected by Hurricane Sandy, with New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia suffering much of the damage and loss of life. Numerous relief efforts and fundraisers emerged after the storm, including the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act passed in January 2013. The Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2013, Public Law 113-2 (also referred to as Sandy Supplemental), appropriated $829 million to the Department of the Interior to respond to and recover from Hurricane Sandy.",
14,US Coastal Resilience and Climate Adaptation,14.3,United States,"Watershed and floodplain planning and investments in the San Francisco Bay Area, US","The watershed and floodplain of San Francisquito Creek, California encompasses approximately 130 square kilometers from the Santa Cruz Mountains to San Francisco Bay. For the planning, design and construction of watershed management projects, over the past five years the SFCJPA has raised over $95 million, including $50 million from local cities and water districts in two counties, $34 million from the State’s water and transportation agencies, and over $10 million from private sources, including a utility and Facebook.

17,Cities,17.1,Australia,"Urban water management in Melbourne, Australia","The city of Melbourne is internationally recognized as a leader in integrated urban water management. To address the multiple types of hazards it faces, including droughts, floods, and heat waves, the city has developed integrated urban water management plans that include nature-based solutions. This case study describes the experience of the Yarra Ranges Council, a municipality in the Greater Melbourne Area that has pioneered innovative approaches to stormwater management"
17,Cities,17.2,France,"Urban planning experiment in Bordeaux, France","The metropolis of Bordeaux consists of 28 municipalities. In addition to large areas of artificialized urban land which include the historical center, the peri-urban landscape also comprises small-scale agricultural land and wine estates, parts of the Landes forest in the North West, large wetlands areas along the Garonne river, as well as rich biodiversity corridors along smaller rivers (e.g. Jalles-de-Blanquefort). The city is currently expanding as it is predicted to reach 1 million inhabitants by 2030 (about 770 000 today). This raises important challenges regarding the ability of the city to ensure long-term biodiversity and ecosystem services protection. To address these issues, the metropolitan authorities have carried out prospective studies since 2011 to better incorporate nature protection into landscape planning and management.",
17,Cities,17.3,France,Urban agriculture on the wild side: Welcome to La Fournillière,"La Fournillière is a district of the French city of Nantes (Figure 1). Historically, the place was occupied by fruit and vegetable canneries that provided kitchen gardens to their employees. During the post-war boom, canneries disappeared, social housing complexes were built and various development projects were proposed to transform the site. The gardeners were evicted and their gardens ceased to exist. However, all these projects were eventually abandoned and, in the seventies, the place turned into a wasteland of more than 3 hectares."
