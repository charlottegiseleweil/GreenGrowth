3,Water Funds: Coordinating Resources & Action For Watershed Improvement,3.1,China,Water Funds locations,These include both operational and pre-operational Water Funds tracked by The Nature Conservancy. The ones labeled in purple correspond to the examples highlighted in this chapter.,
4,Regulatory-Driven Mitigation,4.2,United States,Wetlands Mitigation Banking in the United States,Development projects that impact wetlands are required to mitigate their impacts. Each project mitigated its own impact often on the project site or at an off-site location created for that single development project. However mitigation in this form proved to be ineffective: on-site mitigation resulted in small and isolated wetlands whose quality was impacted by the adjacent development and the country experienced continued wetland losses. This led to the development of wetland mitigation banking as a way to more effectively and reliably mitigate losses of wetlands along with their ecological functions and their services.,
5,Voluntary Conservation,5.2,Brazil,ARPA (Amazon Region Protected Areas Program) with the Transition Fund,"This chapter presents two examples of voluntary conservation: (i) land trusts in the United States and (ii) the Amazon Region Protected Areas program (ARPA) in Brazil. In the case of land trusts, the ecosystem service providers are private landowners, whose actions the government incentivizes through tax breaks. In the case of ARPA, the Brazilian government is the ecosystem service provider, with international funding from private foundations, companies and other governments providing a catalyst for expanding and strengthening its protected area network.",
6,Public Payments - Government Payments,6.1,United States,CRP ( Conservation Reserve Program ),"Farmers whose land-use decisions and management practices affect water quality, soil loss and wildlife habitat are the ecosystem service suppliers. Eligible farmers who choose to enroll in CRP are compensated.",
6,Public Payments - Government Payments,6.3,South Africa,Working for Water in South Africa,"Water scarcity is a major challenge for the country of South Africa. Without increases in water use efficiency, demand for water is projected to exceed supply in the country as a whole by 2025. Invasive alien plants in South Africa use more water than the native vegetation they replace.The Working for Water (WfW) program was launched in 1995 as a public works program to support clearing of invasive alien plants in order to create jobs and secure South Africaâ€™s water resources.",
