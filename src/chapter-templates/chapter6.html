<h5 id="chapter-2-1">2.1: Investing in Climate-Resilient Coastal Development</h5>
<p>
    Coastal climate impacts through sea-level rise, warmer ocean temperatures, and changes in river runoff are 
    exacerbating socio-political and environmental ills facing communities throughout Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), 
    with disproportionate effects on socio-economically vulnerable groups. In this context, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 
    and the Natural Capital Project (NatCap) are co-creating ecosystem-service science and decision support tools for coastal 
    development planning with governments and stakeholders in the LAC region.

<p>
    Goat densities in Mongolia have increased fourfold over the past three decades. 
    Increased livestock density is wreaking havoc on people and wildlife—reducing financial certainty among herders, 
    increasing dust storms, and affecting rangeland suitability for wildlife. To help create a more sustainable and 
    resilient rangeland system, a diverse group of interests is innovating together as the Sustainable Cashmere Project (SCP). 
    SCP works with herders through cooperatives. The Luxury group Kering is developing a sustainable source and supply chain of 
    high-quality cashmere. The Oyu Tolgoi (OT) mining project is applying the International Finance Corporation (IFC)’s 
    performance standards to offset impacts from its large copper and gold mining operation, investing in herder livelihoods and 
    healthy rangelands. The Wildlife Conservation Society engages with local nomadic herders to improve pasture management and 
    access to the developing sustainable cashmere supply chain.

<h5 id="chapter-2-3">2.3: Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP)</h5>
<p>
    China is developing and adopting a new measure – Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) – as a guide to securing sustainable improvements. 
    GEP will help reveal social and economic contributions of ecosystems, highlight ecological connections among regions, guide 
    financial compensation from ecosystem service beneficiaries to regions supplying those services, inform policy in green finance, and 
    serve as a government performance metric. GEP is defined analogously to Gross Domestic Product (GDP): quantities of ecosystem goods and 
    services are multiplied by prices using market and non-market valuation methods, and aggregated to obtain a tractable single measure that, 
    over time, reflects the growth or decline of ecosystem services.
