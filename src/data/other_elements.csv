Among others: loss in primary forests, destruction of ecosystems, endangerment of iconic species. In the recent years more and more voices have raised this concern. Pathways to Green Growth starts from this observation. It has the ambition of moving from ideas to action. More specifically, it aims to Mainstream Natural Capital into Policy and Finance.
