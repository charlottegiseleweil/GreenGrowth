Introduction,"The growth in human numbers and economic activity in the last half century has deeply transformed the planet. There have been some tremendous achievements in favor of human life and country development. However, natural capital has greatly suffered from this increased activity. Among others: loss in primary forests, destruction of ecosystems, endangerment of iconic species. In the recent years more and more voices have raised this concern. Pathways to Green Growth ~\cite{mainbook} starts from this observation. It has the ambition of moving from ideas to action. More specifically, it aims to Mainstream Natural Capital into Policy and Finance. For this, it presents various examples of best-practice for channeling economic resource flows to conservation and restoration of natural capital. It has a rigorous and scientific approach, often using data as support. The project developed here can be thought as an interactive table of contents for Pathways to Green Growth. It locates about 20 case studies across the world. These example are all about ecosystem management (e.g Carbon market, conservation lands, water-funds etc.)."
