This web application is developed in the scope of EPFL Data Visualization course (COM-480).
This project is part of Natural Capital Project of Stanford University. The Natural Capital Project’s data and science platform, anchored by the InVEST software suite, has been used in over 180 countries to map, quantify and value ecosystem services in support of a diversity of policy and finance mechanisms. This project can be thought as a spatial table of contents for the to-be-published book about Green Development and International Experience in Ecosystem Services Management.
This project aims to locate about 20 case studies across the world. These example are all about ecosystem management (e.g Carbon market, conservation lands, water-funds etc.).
